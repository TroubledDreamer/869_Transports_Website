<h1> History Of St.Kitts</h1>
<p>  Present-day Saint Kitts and Nevis was the site of Great Britain’s first Caribbean settlement in 1623.
    <br>Following centuries of British and French colonial rule, Saint Kitts and Nevis, together with Anguilla,became
    <br>a self-governing state in association with Great Britain in 1967.Since the 1983 independence of Saint Kitts and Nevis,
    <br>the two-island federation and the United States have enjoyed friendly diplomatic relations.

</p>
<p>Saint Kitts was named Liamuiga, which roughly translates as 'fertile land', by the Kalinago, who originally inhabited the island.
<br>It is thought that Christopher Columbus, the first European to see the islands in 1493,
<br>named the larger island San Cristóbal, after Saint Christopher, his patron saint and that of travellers.
<br>New studies suggest that Columbus named the island Sant Yago (Saint James), and that the name San Cristóbal
<br>was in fact given by Columbus to the island now known as Saba, 32 km (20 mi) northwest
<br>No matter the origin of the name, the island was well documented as San Cristóbal by the 17th century.

            <h3>“Paradise Island” Reviewed May 7, 2007</h3>
            <p>
                "St. Kitts is a lovely island to visit, lots of
                <br>greenery, monkeys, cows, goats and even
                <br>chickens in the downtown area.<br> I stayed at the Timothy Beach Hotel,
                <br>the room was very nice with an ocean view.
                <br>Beach Bars were wonderful, some don't
                <br>close until their last customer leaves.
                <br>Taxi driver, Roosevelt Taylor, is a gem
                <br>from the island, always there on time to
                <br>pick you up. Lovely place to take a relaxing vacation."

        "We stopped at st. kitts, aboard the SV
        <br>Polynesia, it was March of 2005, and they
        <br>were about to bring in their last sugar cane 
        <br>crop. Weather was your typical Caribbean perfection."

            <h3> “Trip Report - St. Kitts” Reviewed April 16, 2005</h3>
            <p>
                "My wife and I have been visiting St. Kitts
                <br>for over four years now. We go twice a
                <br>year. In May for my birthday and the week
                <br>before Christmas... just because.
                <br>Jeanette (my wife) took me to St. Kitts for
                <br>my 40th Birthday. My only request was
                <br>that I be able to play golf and that there
                <br>was a swim up bar. Boy did I get my moneys worth.
                <br>We always stay at Bird Rock Beach Hotel,
                <br>in the villas, usually in a suite. It's my
                <br>favorite room in the world, even though I 
                <br>spend very little time there. Most of our
                <br>time is spent at the pool, we usually park
                <br>ourselves near the swim up bar.
                <br>The bartenders and staff are all Great!
                <br>Especially Latasha, Vanessa, Nicola, Edris and Vincia.
                <br>They always take great care of us.
